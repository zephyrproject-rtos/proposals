Proposal title - restricted to one line.


Abstract
********
A short description of the issue being addressed.

Motivation
**********

The motivation is crucial for proposals that want to modify the Zephyr code,
established processes, or the ecosystem. It should clearly explain why the
existing implementation or processes are inadequate to address the problem
that the proposal aims at solving. Proposal submissions without sufficient
motivation may be rejected outright.

Background & Rationale
**********************

The section describes in detail why particular design decisions were made.
It should describe any related work present, e.g. how the feature is supported
in other operating systems. The rationale should provide evidence of consensus
within the community and discuss important objections or concerns raised during
discussion.

Rejected Ideas
**************

Throughout the discussion of a proposal, alternative designs or ideas will be
proposed which are not accepted. Those rejected ideas should be recorded along
with the reasoning as to why they were rejected. This both helps record the
thought process behind the final version of the proposal as well as preventing
people from bringing up the same rejected idea again in subsequent discussions.

In a way this section can be thought of as a breakout section of the Rationale
section that is focused specifically on why certain ideas were not ultimately
pursued.

Backwards Compatibility
***********************

All proposals that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section
describing these incompatibilities and their impact and/or severity. The proposal
must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.
Proposal submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be
rejected outright.

Security & Safety Implications
******************************

If there are security concerns in relation to the proposal,
those concerns should be explicitly written out to make sure
reviewers of the proposal are aware of them.

Roadmap and Timelines
*********************

Communicate when to expect the proposal to be implemented or adopted,
should it be accepted by the project community

Unresolved Questions
********************

While a proposal is in draft, ideas can come up which warrant further discussion.
Those ideas should be recorded so people know that they are being thought about
but do not have a concrete resolution. This helps make sure all issues required
for the proposal to be ready for consideration are complete and reduces people
duplicating prior discussions.

Future Work
***********

The author should consider and describe natural improvements, extensions,
or an evolution of the proposal being presented, that are out of scope of
the current proposal. This helps the reviewers evaluate the current proposal
as part of a larger proposal or roadmap, if applicable.

References
**********

A collection of URLs used as references through the proposal.

Motion
******

The motion to be voted on, if voting is required.
